## Courses

Here at **Bitdefender** we are actively involved in designing and teaching Deep Learning and Cryptography courses in partnership with the top universities in Bucharest as well as for our own internal use. Our purpose is to bring students closer to the research field, with both practical and theoretical approaches, with a lot of enthusiasm and up to date content.

{{< course "thumb_unibuc.png" "DeepFMI – Learning Deep Neural Networks" "February – April" "/community/deep-fmi/" >}}
The course is about basic Deep Learning methods, current models and capabilities. It covers basic theoretical concepts about training neural networks, followed by applications in computer vision and natural language understanding, with an accent on the applied part, through labs, assignments and the final project.
