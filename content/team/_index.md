## Machine Learning team

{{< teammember "Elena Burceanu" "elena_burceanu.webp" >}}
I recently defended my PhD thesis in Computer Vision, on *Efficiently Exploiting Space-Time Consensus for Object Segmentation and Tracking in Video*, at University of Bucharest, under Marius Leordeanu and Gheorghe Ștefănescu supervision. My current research interest is in Generalization problems under Distribution Shifts, with a focus on the anomaly detection task.

I am interested in neural generative models for natural language processing, especially for code generation. In particular, I am interested in leveraging discrete structure (syntax trees) to improve the expressiveness of the latent space and to guide the generation process.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Politehnica University of Bucharest. My earlier research focused on anomaly detection in scenarios involving distribution shifts. Currently, I am working on Large Language Models, with an emphasis on enhancing their reasoning capabilities.

Currently pursuing a PhD in Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Prof. Lucian Bușoniu following an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from University Politehnica of Bucharest and a BSc in Philosophy. I have a broad interest in Reinforcement Learning topics and I am currently focusing on questions regarding sample efficiency in the context of model-free value-based methods with neural network estimators.

{{< teammember "Ștefan Smeu" "stefan_smeu.webp" >}}
I studied Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Bucharest, where I got my bachelor's degree and am currently pursuing its Artificial Intelligence Master degree program. I am interested in the unsupervised representation learning branch of deep learning. Nowadays I research the problem of distributional shift and anomaly detection, mainly on visual data.

{{< teammember "Elisabeta Oneață" "elisabeta_oneata.webp" >}}
I have obtained my PhD in computer vision from the School of Advanced Studies of the Romanian Academy (SCOSAAR), with the thesis "Perceptual Models for Computational Visual Analysis", under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Cristian Sminchisescu. My work focused on 3D human pose estimation and perception in monocular images and videos. Currently I am interested in automatic detection of deepfake visual content.

I received my Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, where I worked on automatic action recognition in videos. During my postdoctoral research, I started investigating how to integrate vision with other modalities, such as speech and language. This work showed how visual grounding can help with tasks like speech recognition or language documentation, and how multimodal models relate to human learning. At Bitdefender, I apply multimodal learning to detect deepfakes across various media, including images, audio, and video.
