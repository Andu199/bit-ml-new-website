## Machine Learning team

{{< teammember "Elena Burceanu" "elena_burceanu.webp" >}}
I am a Research Scientist working on robust machine learning, with a current focus on out of distribution generalization: understanding and mitigating distribution shifts, spurious correlations, and shortcut features that hurt reliability in real settings. Recently, I have been increasingly interested in mechanistic interpretability as a way to diagnose why models latch onto spurious cues and to design interventions that improve generalization. I was an Associate Program Chair at NeurIPS 2025 and I am the Local Chair for CoLLAs 2026, Bucharest.

I am interested in neural generative models for natural language processing, especially for code generation. In particular, I am interested in leveraging discrete structure (syntax trees) to improve the expressiveness of the latent space and to guide the generation process.

{{< teammember "Andrei Manolache" "andrei_manolache.webp" >}}
I am a Ph.D. student at the IMPRS-IS and ELLIS, under the co-supervision of Mathias Niepert (University of Stuttgart) and Karsten Borgwardt (ETH Zürich & MPI-B) and a Researcher at Bitdefender's Theoretical Research Laboratory. My focus is on robustness and trustworthiness of Geometric Deep Learning methods.

{{< teammember "Marius Drăgoi" "marius_dragoi.webp" >}}
I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from Politehnica University of Bucharest. My earlier research focused on anomaly detection in scenarios involving distribution shifts. Currently, I am working on Large Language Models, with an emphasis on enhancing their reasoning capabilities.

{{< teammember "Florin Gogianu" "florin_gogianu.webp" >}}
Currently pursuing a PhD in Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of Prof. Lucian Bușoniu following an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from University Politehnica of Bucharest and a BSc in Philosophy. I have a broad interest in Reinforcement Learning topics and I am currently focusing on questions regarding sample efficiency in the context of model-free value-based methods with neural network estimators.

{{< teammember "Elisabeta Oneață" "elisabeta_oneata.webp" >}}
I have obtained my PhD in computer vision from the School of Advanced Studies of the Romanian Academy (SCOSAAR), with the thesis "Perceptual Models for Computational Visual Analysis", under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Cristian Sminchisescu. My work focused on 3D human pose estimation and perception in monocular images and videos. Currently I am interested in automatic detection of deepfake visual content.

{{< teammember "Dan Oneață" "dan_oneata.webp" >}}
I received my Ph.D. from Université Grenoble Alpes, where I worked on automatic action recognition in videos. During my postdoctoral research, I started investigating how to integrate vision with other modalities, such as speech and language. This work showed how visual grounding can help with tasks like speech recognition or language documentation, and how multimodal models relate to human learning. At Bitdefender, I apply multimodal learning to detect deepfakes across various media, including images, audio, and video.
